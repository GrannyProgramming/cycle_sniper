# Cycle Sniper Signals Guide

## Types of Signals

### Daily Cycle Low (DCL)
- **Color**: Green marker
- **Purpose**: Identifies potential daily cycle bottoms
- **Location**: Below price bars, offset by 2 bars
- **Best Entry**: When price reclaims FRAMA (yellow line)

### Weekly Cycle Low (WCL)
- **Color**: Blue marker
- **Purpose**: Identifies potential weekly cycle bottoms
- **Location**: Below price bars, offset by 5 bars
- **Best Entry**: When price reclaims FRAMA (blue line)

## How Signals Work

### Signal Generation
1. **Price Action Requirements**
   - DCL: 3 bars below FRAMA within 4-bar period
   - WCL: 3 bars below FRAMA within 8-bar period
   - Current close must be above respective FRAMA

2. **Prediction Zones**
   - Green background: Potential DCL zone
   - Blue background: Potential WCL zone
   - Higher probability when signals appear in these zones

## High-Probability Setups

### Perfect Setup (Strongest)
- Signal appears in prediction zone
- Price reclaims FRAMA line
- UP/Down confirmation present (if enabled)
- DCL and WCL signals align (Â±3-5 bars)

### Standard Setup (Good)
- Signal appears near prediction zone
- Price reclaims FRAMA line
- Single cycle signal with strong confirmation

## Common Issues & Solutions

### False Signals
1. **Early Reversal**
   - **Problem**: Price reverses immediately after signal
   - **Solution**: Wait for 3+ bars above FRAMA before entry

2. **Outside Prediction Zone**
   - **Problem**: Signal appears outside colored background
   - **Solution**: Require stronger confirmation or skip signal

3. **Multiple Close Signals**
   - **Problem**: Several signals appear close together
   - **Solution**: Take only first signal in prediction zone

### Missed Signals
1. **No Signal at Bottom**
   - **Cause**: Insufficient price action for FRAMA confirmation
   - **Solution**: Monitor prediction zones for manual entries

2. **Late Signals**
   - **Cause**: Delayed FRAMA crossover
   - **Solution**: Scale in during prediction zones

## Position Sizing Guide

### Full Position (100%)
- DCL + WCL alignment
- Within prediction zones
- Clear FRAMA reclaim
- Strong UP/Down confirmation

### Half Position (50%)
- Single cycle signal
- Within prediction zone
- Clear FRAMA reclaim

### Quarter Position (25%)
- Single cycle signal
- Outside prediction zone
- Requires additional confirmation

## Quick Tips

1. **Best Entries**
   - Wait for FRAMA reclaim
   - Enter during prediction zones
   - Use UP/Down confirmation
   - Look for DCL + WCL alignment

2. **Risk Management**
   - Stop below recent swing low
   - Tighter stops in prediction zones
   - Wider stops outside zones

3. **Avoid Trading When**
   - Signals outside prediction zones
   - Unclear FRAMA interaction
   - No UP/Down confirmation
   - High market volatility
